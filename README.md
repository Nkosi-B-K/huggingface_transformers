# huggingface_transformers

Use of the transformers pipeline, then connecting to a language model, providing an input and receiving an output. Technologies used: Transformers, Pipeline, Sentiment Classifier. I looked to complete sentiment analysis in this project. A pipeline for NER (Named Entity Recognition) was also used with a chosen model. I worked with PyTorch and TensorFlow as well to fine tune the chosen model. I concluded the project by saving the models.
